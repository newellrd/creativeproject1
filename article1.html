         <h3>The citizens of this small town in Pennsylvania woke up this morning with no clue for what the day would hold.</h3>
         <p>In a strange occurrence today, the weather was raining pencils in Eraser, “Pencil”vania. Although citizens were surprised by this turn of events, most were prepared with sharpeners in hand. One small injury was reported, where a child allegedly looked up into the sky and was met with 3 pencils in the eye. The mother reports he will be okay, although he may suffer lead eye poisoning for the next 7 months. “What a miracle he even survived! Here we thought today would be pretzel day, not pencil day,” the mother shared with reporters on the scene. This day is one to be written down in history; however the folks of Eraser hope it won’t be in pencil.</p>
